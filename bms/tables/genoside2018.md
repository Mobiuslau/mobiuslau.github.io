# GENOSIDE 2018 Tables

<meta name="bmstable" content="genoside2018.json">

This table contains the [GENOSIDE 2018](http://www.dream-pro.info/~lavalse/LR2IR/search.cgi?mode=gradelist) Dan courses for use with Beatoraja. The imposed constraints are (LN was removed as it is not included in the courses in the insane2 table):
```json
"constraint": [
    "grade_mirror",
    "gauge_lr2"
],
```
It was mainly created for use with Bokutachi, since existing tables with these dan courses used different constraints. 

Both SP and DP courses are implemented. The courses can be recognised as follows:
