# 🡾GENOSIDE 2018 Course Table

<meta name="bmstable" content="genoside2018.json">

This table contains the [GENOSIDE 2018](http://www.dream-pro.info/~lavalse/LR2IR/search.cgi?mode=gradelist) Dan courses for use with Beatoraja. The imposed constraints are (LN was removed as it is not included in the courses in the insane2 table):
```json
"constraint": [
    "grade_mirror",
    "gauge_lr2"
],
```
It was mainly created for use with Bokutachi, since existing tables with these dan courses used different constraints. 

Both SP and DP courses are implemented. The courses can be recognised as follows:

|Japanese|English|
|:-|:-|
|段位認定|SP|
|DP段位認定|DP|
|||
|初段|First dan|
|二段|2nd dan|
|三段|3rd dan|
|四段|4th dan|
|五段|5th dan|
|六段|6th dan|
|七段|7th dan|
|八段|8th dan|
|九段|9th dan|
|十段|10th dan|
|||
|発狂|Insane courses|

The 'original' Beatoraja tables can be found here (Note that Bokutachi will not accept the constraints for some of these courses, which is why this table exists):
