***WORK IN PROGRESS***

There are often moments of discovery during, or discussions about, *Sound voltex* gameplay, since it is a rhythm game which (not exclusive) often requires some amount of creativity for hitting patterns, especially as the difficulty of the charts increases. With a subset of the playerbase which may actively seek to improve or develop their skill, it might be difficult to get a grasp of the different kinds of ideas players have come up with to tackle different kinds of gameplay situations. 

As such, this page serves as;

1. a place for me to document the discoveries I have personally made during gameplay,
2. an exhaustive list of techniques and tips players have come up with for gameplay,
3. a reference for ideas I have discussed with or explained to other players in the past.

As a result, this page will eternally be in development as new techniques or ideas might be discovered, either by me or by other players in the future.

I would like to present a disclaimer that the purpose of this page is not to enforce players to incorporate these ideas. It is not a requirement to treat this material for players to have fun playing the game: If you have fun playing the game, you have fun playing the game. However, for those who have fun playing the game, and simultaneously have fun seeking out new strategies or find ways to more effectively develop skill, this page might hopefully provide new ideas or provoke thought. This page should not be interpreted as a rulebook on how players should play, but provoke thought and ideas which could or might not be incorporated into play. In the end it's a techniques and tips page, not a how-to-play page.

The second disclaimer is that I am by no means a top ranker, such that there might be some ideas and/or strategies missing from this page, ill-described, not actually effective or result in bad habits. In such a case I welcome advise to improve this work. I am someone who likes to think and optimise, such that there might be players who could take those ideas and go to the moon with them. Ideally I would like for this work to be a collaborative effort in some parts, appropriately credited where help, or advice was received.

This page is split up into three parts:

1. Physical Habits
2. Techniques & ideas.
3. Specific pattern ideas.
4. Ideas on improvement.
