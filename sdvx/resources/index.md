# Sound Voltex Resources
{:.no_toc}

It is undenyable that the *SOUND VOLTEX* series has grown in popularity throughout the years. As such, many players, maintainers, and other users have been making many contributious to the community, such as guides, messaging platforms, and even their own games simulating the *SOUND VOLTEX* gameplay experience along with custom charts. Through the years, many resources have accumulated in various places. As such, this webpage is an accumulation of those resources created by the community, official resources, and a parts list for controllers. This web page contains everything *SOUND VOLTEX*. 

This webpage may not always be up to date with the newest resources available. An effort is made to update it somewhat regularly, however. I would greatly appreciate it if the reader would notify me of a new resource which would be useful to list here.

The #faq-guides channel in the [SDVX Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sdvx) contains resources and useful information as well, such as guides on setting up *SOUND VOLTEX EXCEED GEAR コナステ*, a Buyers guide for controllers, Useful links, and other recommendations. It is therefore advised to read this as well since it can not be hot-linked from this webpage. However, an effort was made to collect publically available resources mentioned there.

Outdated resources and dead links are kept for a while for archival purposes.

## Controllers

The simplest way to get started is to buy a controller. Please do your research before purchasing one. Make an educated decision by reading and/or watching reviews, or inquire community members and/or the vendors about the controller models available.

However, building a controller yourself might be cheaper, and perhaps more fun for those who like building things. In that case, the [parts](#parts) sections below may be useful.

### Guides

#### Which Buttons and Switches to Buy?

***It is recommended to read other sources as well to make educated purchases! Do not use this as your sole source. If in doubt, ask around.***

Before purchasing a controller, or the parts for a DIY controller, a choice has to be made on the button, microswitche and spring configuration. When buying a controller specifically, usually the user is prompted to select specific parts from drop-down lists. But which ones to buy?

For those unfamiliar, the entire button configuration consists of the following 4 parts:

- a microswitch which sits in the button housing,
- the button piece which anctuates the microswitch when pressing it,
- a spring which sita in the housing lifting the button piece.
- a screw which holds the button housing in place in the controller.

First and foremost: *don't buy Sanwa buttons unless you're already a seasoned player and can not sleep without having a more arcade accurate setup*. They are extremely expensive and really not worth it for a beginner or intermediate player to consider (even seasoned players don't strictly *need* them). Even though they are used in actual arcade cabinets (see the [parts](#parts) section below), the difference in feel is mostly a luxury while the default button options (such as DJ DAO buttons) are usually sufficient and can be used to achieve great scores too!

When it comes to microswitches, it is often recommended to buy OMRON microswitches. The durability and feel are usually considered well worth the slight increase in price. Popular choices are:

- 50g: `OMRON D2MV-01-1C3`.
- 100g: `OMRON V-10-1A4`.
- 50g: `OMRON VX-01-1A3`.

Arcade accurate would be the "integrated" switch `OBSA-LHS1F-LN`, which **can only be used with Sanwa buttons** (more on arcade specs in the [parts](#parts) section) [^gamerepairSdvx] [^bluespringIntegrated]. However, not every vendor lists this as an option, and it might be considerably more expensive. The OMRON options listed above are just fine. Note that the `OBSA-LHS1F-LN` might feel slightly heavier compared to the `OMRON V-10-1A4` 100g switch [^hoshikara].

Apart from the part manufacturer, the most important aspects to drastically change the feel of the button are the weights of the microswitch and spring. The weight combination between the spring and microswitch is often denoted as \\(m_{\textup{microswitch}}/m_{\textup{spring}}\\), with \\(m\\) the weight of the part in grams. For instance: `100/20` would be a configuration with 100g microswitches and 20g springs. Common configurations are:

- **100/20**: 100g `OMRON V-10-1A4` switches with 20g springs.<br>A light and responsive setup.
- **100/40**: 100g `OMRON V-10-1A4` switches with 40g springs.<br>This weight is the most arcade-like, even though cabinets use 20g springs [^hoshikara].
- **50/60**: 100g `OMRON V-10-1A4` switches with 40g springs.<Br>This often used to be recommended to beginners due to its balanced feel.

Arcade accurate would be Sanwa buttons with `OBSA-LHS1F-LN` switches and 20g springs. For a more comprehensive rundown of parts, see the [parts](#parts) section.

For more wisdom on microswitches, see [Subjective Thoughts on Switch Choices for Controllers](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Subjective_Thoughts_on_Switch_Choices_for_Controllers#Omron_V-10-1A4_/_Sanwa_MS-O-3) on [Rhythm Cons Wiki](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Main_Page).

### Controller Parts

The parts as listed below could be used with most (diy) controllers. 

#### Buttons

The Sanwa buttons listed below are analogous to arcade spec. These buttons ship with the old lamp holder type. This is more convenient for home use since the microswitch can be replaced easily, and the *Sanwa OBSA-LHS1F-LN* switch wiring is less convenient for home controller use. They can ship with an *Sanwa OBSA-SP* 100g spring, an *MS-O-3* (Omron V-10-1A4) 100g microswitch, and either a LED, or a Wedge Bulb Lamp (See Rakuten & Tops Game product pages). One can choose to buy the button only, without a switch or lamp as well.

Of course, the *Sanwa OBSA-LHS1F-LN* switch could still be used with Sanwa buttons if wired properly. [This listing on Blue Spring Express](https://bluespringexpress.net/en-us/products/lhs1f-switch-and-harness-set-for-sdvx) includes wires such that the switches can be used with Gamo2 and Yuancon controllers. It goes without saying that this switch is only compatible with Sanwa buttons.

See <a href="sanwa_button_product_codes">This table</a> for a description of the button product codes [^topsBt] [^topsFx] [^topsSt].

The list below also includes other buttons, as Sanwa buttons can be rather expensive to obtain.

#### Microswitches

Always check the datasheets if supplied for the details and operating forces. Some switches have different terminal types which may be useful to some users. Certain users have documented their experiences with, and opinions about, some of these switches, which can be found [here](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Subjective_Thoughts_on_Switch_Choices_for_Controllers). It may be useful to consult this article when choosing a switch. There are more stores which sell these switches which may not be listed here. As such it is recommended to perform research.

The *Sanwa OBSA-LHS1F-LN* switch used in Valkyrie cabinets could still be used with Sanwa buttons if wired properly. [This listing on Blue Spring Express](https://bluespringexpress.net/en-us/products/lhs1f-switch-and-harness-set-for-sdvx) includes wires such that the switches can be used with Gamo2 and Yuancon controllers. It goes without saying that this switch is only compatible with Sanwa buttons.
