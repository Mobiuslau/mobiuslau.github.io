# Sound Voltex Resources
{:.no_toc}

It is undenyable that the *SOUND VOLTEX* series has grown in popularity throughout the years. As such, many players, maintainers, and other users have been making many contributious to the community, such as guides, messaging platforms, and even their own games simulating the *SOUND VOLTEX* gameplay experience along with custom charts. Through the years, many resources have accumulated in various places. As such, this webpage is an accumulation of those resources created by the community, official resources, and a parts list for controllers. This web page contains everything *SOUND VOLTEX*. 

This webpage may not always be up to date with the newest resources available. An effort is made to update it somewhat regularly, however. The author is open to suggestions for inclusions.

The #faq-guides channel in the [SDVX Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sdvx) contains resources and useful information as well, such as guides on setting up *SOUND VOLTEX EXCEED GEAR コナステ*, a Buyers guide for controllers, Useful links, and other recommendations. It is therefore advised to read this as well since it can not be hot-linked from this webpage. However, an effort was made to collect publically available resources mentioned there.

### Arcade Spec Parts Korean Cabinets

In Korea, *Uniana* is responsible for launching *SOUND VOLTEX* cabinets [[13](http://www.uniana.com/main.php?mid=menu13), [14](http://www.uniana.com/main.php?mid=menu21)]. A different button configuration is used in cabinets in Korea [*Citation Needed*].

W.I.P.

### Controller Parts

The parts as listed below could be used with most (diy) controllers. 

#### Buttons

The Sanwa buttons listed below are analogous to arcade spec. These buttons ship with the old lamp holder type. This is more convenient for home use since the microswitch can be replaced easily, and the *Sanwa OBSA-LHS1F-LN* switch wiring is less convenient for home controller use. They can ship with an *Sanwa OBSA-SP* 100g spring, an *MS-O-3* (Omron V-10-1A4) 100g microswitch, and either a LED, or a Wedge Bulb Lamp (See Rakuten & Tops Game product pages). One can choose to buy the button only, without a switch or lamp as well.

Of course, the *Sanwa OBSA-LHS1F-LN* switch could still be used with Sanwa buttons if wired properly. [This listing on Blue Spring Express](https://bluespringexpress.net/en-us/products/lhs1f-switch-and-harness-set-for-sdvx) includes wires such that the switches can be used with Gamo2 and Yuancon controllers. It goes without saying that this switch is only compatible with Sanwa buttons.

See <a href="sanwa_button_product_codes">This table</a> for a description of the button product codes [[1](https://www.tops-game.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=4740), [2](https://www.tops-game.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=4738), [3](https://www.tops-game.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=4741)].

The list below also includes other buttons, as Sanwa buttons can be rather expensive to obtain.

#### Microswitches

Always check the datasheets if supplied for the details and operating forces. Some switches have different terminal types which may be useful to some users. Certain users have documented their experiences with, and opinions about, some of these switches, which can be found [here](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Subjective_Thoughts_on_Switch_Choices_for_Controllers). It may be useful to consult this article when choosing a switch. There are more stores which sell these switches which may not be listed here. As such it is recommended to perform research.

The *Sanwa OBSA-LHS1F-LN* switch used in Valkyrie cabinets could still be used with Sanwa buttons if wired properly. [This listing on Blue Spring Express](https://bluespringexpress.net/en-us/products/lhs1f-switch-and-harness-set-for-sdvx) includes wires such that the switches can be used with Gamo2 and Yuancon controllers. It goes without saying that this switch is only compatible with Sanwa buttons.
