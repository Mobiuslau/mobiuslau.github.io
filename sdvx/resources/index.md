- **[K-Shoot MANIA (International)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/internationalksm/about)**. <br>The OG KSM / SDVX community, along with the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/new/). This group was established early 2015. It's most prominent members at the time can still be found in the various communities listed above. It is not active anymore and listing it here merely serves as a homage to what it once was. This also counts for the [forum](https://kshootmania.forumotion.com/) which was founded by some of the members of the Facebook group. It is suffice to say that this forum is now inactive as well.
