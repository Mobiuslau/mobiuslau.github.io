# Hello! ðŸ˜Š

I like documenting things I find interesting. This is not my portfolio though.

I'm a theoretical physics grad student who loves to make music, make graphic designs and play rhythm games like Sound Voltex, Jubeat and Beatmania IIDX.

Perhaps you'll find something interesting here.

Feel free to contact me. I can be found in [Kalesy's Hub Discord server](https://discord.gg/SQH7wsX).
